Hello! My name is Amy and I am a fourth year student at the University of Virginia. I'm studying computer science and aspire to be a full stack developer after I graduate, as I have 
an interest in both back-end and front-end development. 


During my free time, I enjoy reading ([Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33768610-amy)), writing, and spending time with my pet rabbit. I also adore
dogs and hope to own one in the future. I drink a lot of coffee and tea and chocolate is my guilty pleasure. 

I had been toying with the idea of making my own website as a way of documenting my experiences transitioning from college to the post-graduate life, since I'll be graduating
soon and my life will be changing significantly. Hopefully this can be an interesting read for you as well.
