title = "Partner for Mental Health Management System"

+++

For my Capstone project, my group and I were assigned to build a system for the Partner for Mental Health, a local non-profit organization that assists its clients in finding proper treatment in the community and aims to better educate the public in its view of mental health. This is a year-long project that will be complete by the end of Spring 2017.

The goal of the software is to facilitate the transition from a complete paper system to an electronic one. Our website, coded with Ruby on Rails, is for the administrators' use only to keep track of each client's personal information and appointment schedule. 

**Images depicted:** Home page, signup page, resetting the password, the dashboard, client profile, and a calendar to set up meetings.
