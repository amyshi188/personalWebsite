For my Human Computer-Interaction class last semester, my group and I designed an application that would allow users to transform into an animal. While this is obviously not realistic, we enjoyed thinking out of the box. After agreeing on the general purpose of the app, we broke it down through a user and task analysis to figure out what situations it would be beneficial in and the user base we wanted to target. We then made three sets of prototypes to visualize what the app would look like on different platforms: a physical machine, mobile device, and a wearable. I designed the mobile device version.
