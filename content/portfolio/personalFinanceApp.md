For my mobile develpment class, my partner and I created an Android application where users can have their own finance portfolio. The app allows users to quickly look up a given stockâ€™s latest financial information and key metrics. The app also allows users to add a given stock position (where a position is defined by a stock and number of shares) into a portfolio, which is a central hub of aggregated stock data. Users can then look at a breakdown of their portfolio positions by weight as well as basic portfolio metrics.

I handled the design, so I drew two sets of wireframes and tested them among a few classmates to see which was preferred. We ended up going with design 2.

**Images depicted:** For each design, there is the summary page, managing stock positions, and locate nearby adviser.
