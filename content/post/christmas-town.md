I don't travel very much over breaks for various reasons, but this year me and my family went to Busch Gardens (I realize that it technically does not count as traveling or vacation because it is only a three-hour drive, but I'm classifying it that way) to visit Christmas Town. We also gave ourselves time for shopping.

We left the house early in the morning and arrived at Williamsburg at around lunch time. I drove us directly to the Williamsburg Premium Outlets because I saw online while researching information about this trip that it has a large number of shops and many of them are factory/outlet stores. We ate lunch at a restaurant in the mall and then spent the next three hours shopping. I can confidently say I had a productive shopping trip, but it only took so long because the mall is HUGE. It was one of those outside malls so it took longer to walk around; also, since it was basically the size of a regular shopping plaza times three, I had to memorize where stores were to save time. At least it forced me to be efficient and not dawdle around looking at things I didn't need.

At around 3:30 PM, we rushed over to Busch Gardens so that we'd have a few hours to look around before we had to leave - this was a day trip so we had to leave time for the three-hour drive home. It was my first time at Busch Gardens, actually, so I didn't know what to expect. Christmas Town turned out to be so much bigger than I anticipated, as I thought it was going to be a section of the park with some light displays and that we would surely be out of there in a couple of hours but I was very wrong. On the tram ride from the parking lot to the park, the voice on the speakers mentioned that there were eight million lights lit up in the park. That isn't an exaggeration at all.

They split the park into various European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and England. Every country was beautifully-decorated in a different color scheme of lights. Every house was lined with lights and Christmas music in the respective languages played over the speakers. Combined with the cold winter air, it definitely created the exciting holiday cheer that we all aspire to have during this time of year. We passed by a few animal exhibits that showed horses, eagles, and sheep, which was a nice touch. There was one cute sheep that really enjoyed being petted and would lean against the fence to let people know that it wanted more attention. They had shows playing during multiple scheduled times throughout the park but we either passed by the locations way before or after the next start time or the lines were ridiculously long. 

We didn't go on that many rides but we spent a good amount of time on the train and the arcade. The train was a nice addition to Christmas Town because it spanned such a large area and walking became tiring (even though sometimes the wait for the next train was long at the end of the day and everyone was freezing); it also allowed people to see the trees and bushes that were lit up on the way to the next station. We stopped at Holiday Junction for a break and ended up spending all our time at the arcade. We actually got pretty lucky, since I somehow acquired five hundred tickets from one of the games and my dad obtained a thousand from another. In addition to the other smaller numbers of tickets we had gotten, we had enough to trade them in for a kaleidescope lamp and a box of dominoes. Time and money well spent. 

Our last item on the agenda after walking around in Italy was to grab dinner in Germany. There was this really big building that had a cafeteria inside and a show where people dressed up in holiday costumes and sung and danced to classical Christmas songs. We were able to catch that show while we ate and it was lovely. 

By the time we finished, it was unfortunately too late to visit any other places. I originally wanted to go on a couple more rides but it was getting late and we had to get home before we got too tired to drive. Overall it was a worthwhile trip and I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths the staff at Busch Gardens went to to make the event enjoyable. 

Happy holidays everyone, and happy new year!
