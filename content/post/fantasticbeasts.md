+++

I went to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them last night. As a huge Harry Potter fan and someone who has grown up with the series, I was extremely excited to see the first movie of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. However, as hyped as I was from watching the trailers, I did not know what to expect from it because I knew it was part of the same universe as Harry Potter and that it was a prequel, but nothing else was provided about the story.

The movie ended up being absolutely delightful and magical. It made me fall in love all over again with the magical world and made me realize how much I had missed it. It had been a while since I read the last Harry Potter book and watched the last movie (or any Harry Potter movies for that matter) so I had forgotten what it was like to be immersed in that kind of experience again. I have seen some mixed reviews online but let's be honest, I am not a movie critic so I am not here to analyze and undertones and hidden messages behind the script. Was it perfect? I don't think so. But it was wonderful to watch and I think J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job writing the movie.

I also always knew Eddie Redmayne was a talented and handsome actor, but watching him play the main character in Fantastic Beasts made me truly appreciate how perfect he was for the role of Newt Scamander. Sweet, quirky, awkward but compassionate, Eddie portrayed Newt exactly how I would've imagined him to be, even in the smaller details like his mannerisms. The characters were all very likeable; I especially loved Queenie, who comes off as a ditzy and flirty girl when you first meet her but reveals herself to be extremely kind, nonjudgmental, and intelligent. Jacob was so hilarious and added a comedic side to an action-packed movie that was rather dark in some parts, so I was really glad that casted him. His friendship with Newt was so enchanting. 

As the title indicates, there are many creatures and mythical animals in this movie, and they are so majestic and adorable that you wish you were there to see them in person too. Newt cares for all of his creatures in his case, which serves as the entrance to a world beyond anything you can imagine. I don't want to give too much away, but my favorites were the bowtruckle (I was so upset when Newt almost gave it away) and the platypus-looking animal that was attracted to shiny things. That one made me laugh so much, especially when he stood in the jewelry shop window trying to pass as a mannequin. There were a lot of really great scenes and minor details that made me love the movie more with every passing minute, but I won't spoil all of it. Either way, I definitely want to experience it again.
