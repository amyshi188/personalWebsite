title = "The Perfect Pen"

+++

Before I started delving into the world of stationary, I had heard terms thrown around such as "pen snob" and similar classifications with notebooks and planners. Despite that I love organizing and discovering new ways to keep my life in order, I dismissed the idea because I knew I couldn't afford to splurge on extremely nice stationary. That statement still holds true. But I did do a lot of research and spent the past year or so seeking the "perfect" pen that stayed within my budget. Or at least the pen that works best for me, one that I would want to stick to for a long time. 

Perhaps this sounds like a trivial post because it is just a pen after all, right? Most people would be content buying a ten-pack of Bic pens. But as someone who really values the qualities of putting pen to paper and the feel of a high-quality notebook, this kind of thing matters to me. I didn't notice until college that I have very small handwriting, and that certain pens did not feel comfortable because they were too cumbersome. I take a good amount of my notes by hand because I find it helps me study better, so I wanted a pen that I would look forward to write with frequently. I started off with the Pilot black gel ink pen (0.7 mm) because I knew that one was popular. I liked it at first, but then I saw they had the same pen in 0.5 mm. That one felt better, but the size of the tip did not feel fine enough. It felt like it was kind of at an awkward size and sometimes the ink would not come out smoothly. Then I tried out a pen one of my friends used, the Pilot Hi-Tec-C Maica gel pen; that kept me content for a few months. I used the 0.4 mm first and then the 0.3 mm. 0.3 mm was a bit too thin and scratchy for me, so I was leaning more towards 0.4 mm. I did like the Maica, but the part where you place your hand is uneven and it hurts your finger after a while.

Then I came across the Muji pen, a pen crafted in Japan that comes in 0.38 mm. The reviews on Amazon were extremely positive, and I could get a pack of ten for a low price. I have been using it for the past few months and I think I have found the right pen for me. It is comfortable, the nib size suits my handwriting, and the ink has never feathered or stopped flowing. 10 out of 10 would recommend. 

Again, I know this sounds like a lot of work just to find a nice pen. In the past I wasn't even aware that there is a community out there for this subject. I'm glad I looked into it though, because it has made me love writing even more than before. Besides taking class notes, I use a bullet journal as my planner and also keep a personal journal, so I basically use this pen for everything.
