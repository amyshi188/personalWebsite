It hasn't really sunk in yet that I am entering my last year of college. Looking back on it, time has really flown by. As a high school senior, I was skeptical of those who told me that time in college passed by even faster than high school (which in my experience, passed by fairly slowly). In my eager, teenage mind, four years sounded like a long time. It was four years of learning to be independent and making my own decisions about what I wanted to do in the future. Four entire years to meet new people and feel lucky that I was accepted into my dream school. 

But of course, going through countless sleepless nights and running from classes to group meetings to extracurricular events and job hunting really made me lose track of time. I went through my first three years looking up to the fourth years. They seemed to have their lives together and didn't stress about classes nearly as much as I did. Many of my older friends already had a solid plan of their post-grad life or had secured a job offer early in the year. 

Now that I am in their shoes, I am realizing that there is so much more to that. I may be nearing the completion of my major, but after a year I will be a "full-grown adult". I will no longer be in school - something I have spent the majority of my life on so far. I will be working full-time and making a living for myself. Everything that I have worked so hard for has led up to this. To be honest, I am actually really looking forward to starting a new chapter of my life; the thought of never being in a place with people who are all around my age again is a bit saddening and scary, but at the same time I feel ready. 

Sometimes I do wish I had taken pauses in my busy schedule to truly savor my time at UVA though. The more difficult my classes became, the more focused I was on academics and not so much on taking full advantage of being a student at one of the most beautiful universities in the world. 

That is a goal I am setting for myself for my fourth year. I don't think the weeks are going to be any easier, but I want to make the most of the time I have left. The new students have been moving into their dorms lately and knowing that they are as excited to start college as I was three years ago emphasizes the fact that soon I will no longer experience the anticipation of a new school year. While the future looks promising, I will certainly miss the structure and lifestyle of being an undergraduate student.
