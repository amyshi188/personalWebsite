Happy fall!

Fall is my favorite season, as it is for many people. There is just something about it that makes me feel warm and cozy inside; not to mention fall fashion is my favorite. 

Today, my school hosted an event called Puppies and Pumpkins. They do it every year so this wasn't my first time, but when there are puppies, pumpkins, and snacks involved, I of course have to go again every year. 

In the past, whenever I got to the event on time, there weren't many people there yet, so this year I decided to arrive a few minutes after the start time. But for some reason everyone was early today and there were long lines and clusters of people everywhere. Luckily I was able to grab a pumpkin before they ran out.

I had never carved a pumpkin prior to this day. I always thought I'd be terrible at it because it just does not seem like a very flexible canvas to work on. I have seen people's pictures of their finished pumpkins before and they carved elaborate designs of people's faces, calligraphy, and animals and I just could not picture myself being able to create anything even close to that. I decided to give it a try today and it turned out to be a success I would say!
