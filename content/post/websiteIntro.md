As I mentioned briefly in my About page, I started this website as a side project because I wanted a place to record my thoughts and the changes in my life that will occur as I near graduation and after I become a full-fledged adult (I know, I have technically been an adult for a while now but considering I've been in school the entire time, the transition has not felt significant). I also became interested in front-end development this summer during my internship and I thought this would be a good way to hone my skills. I have spent more of my coursework on backend development, so as an aspiring full-stack engineer, I should be familiar with both ends of the spectrum.

That being said, this idea started out as me just wanting to have a blog. But then I thought, why not make it have a portfolio of my experience too? Why not make a website that is entirely my own? 

Thanks to the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), I was able to save money on the resources necessary to start my new project. I chose to purchase my domain from Namecheap and host my server on Digital Ocean. At first, I was looking into hosting a Wordpress blog on this domain, but then I came across static site generators and that caught my interest. The fact that I could store all of my website content in a Github repository and use the ever-so-familiar `git push` and `git pull` commands to update the site was a very cool idea to me. Moreover, this seemed more challenging to me as a software developer. Rather than use the conventional editor on sites like Wordpress and Blogger, I get to write everything in my text editor of choice and customize with Markdown. Yes, it's a bit more out of the way and I can't bold/italicize/add images with the click of a button, but it has all been a rewarding experience so far. 

In more detail, the way Hugo.io works is that it parses Markdown files that the user creates and generates the content as HTML pages based on templated-themes. Hugo has a built-in server that can be used to run the website; but this server is a standalone program that has to be run on a server. In my case, I went with Digital Ocean not just because of its affordability, but because I am already familiar with operating system (Ubuntu).
