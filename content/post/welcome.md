If you asked me what my favorite place is, I would say my top answer is a bookstore. Reading has been one of my hobbies since childhood; I could stay in the library or bookstore for hours and find endless entertainment. One of my life goals is to build a personal library when I own a house that I know I'm going to stay in for a while. There's something very satisfying about looking at organized bookshelves filled with books written about anything and everything. So much knowledge to be taken in. Earlier this summer, I went on a trip to Chincoteague, VA with my high school friends, and one of the shops we explored was a small but very cute bookstore, where your purchases were wrapped up in brown paper, making them feel like gift-wrapped packages especially for you. 


Sadly, I stopped reading very much when high school became extremely busy with extracurriculars, SATs, and college applications. Even during my time at college so far, I've found myself wanting to pick up a good book purely for enjoyment. But without a car, I did not have easy access to public libraries. This summer I decided to buy myself a Kindle in addition to a couple of paper copy books to start up my love for reading again. I did not realize just how much I missed it, but now that I've read a good number of books this summer I just keep building up my list of to-read books. To be honest, I don't have a specific genre that I read from. While most books I read are fiction, I sometimes find myself interested in memoirs and other nonfiction books. 

Here are my favorites from the summer so far: 

**The Lunar Chronicles** by Marissa Meyer (a series of four books) - I was introduced to this series by a friend and I am so glad that I read it. I love that every book is based off a different fairytale character, but with a twist. It is a very cleverly-written series and the characters are so lovable. I highly recommend it.

**A Game of Thrones** by George R. R. Martin - I was intrigued by this series for a while, mostly due to the hype surrounding the show, but I still don't think I could stomach the show because of what I've heard about how gory it can be. But the story sounded interesting to me (partially because it reminds me a lot of Skyrim, a game that I love) so I started reading the first book. The characters were definitely confusing to keep up with at times but the list at the end with the names organized by house was helpful. It was a lengthy and dense novel but I still gave it five stars on Goodreads because I was never bored by the story.
