### Work Experience 

##### **Developer Intern - Center for Open Science**
As an intern at the Center for Open Science, I was part of the team to help further the company's mission statement, which encourages the openness of scientific research. I worked on a Peer Reviews project with other interns, which was linked to the Conferences project that allowed users to create conferences, attach talks, and assign peer reviewers who would give a numeric grade to the submissions. As an addition to the Open Science Framework, it would allow users to communicate better and to organize meetings in an efficient way. I also worked on bugs and improvements for the Open Science Framework; this code made it through production and was merged into the actual website. 

##### **Research Assistant - University of Virginia**
I used Unity3D to create virtual worlds that would be used in psychological and cognitive studies. These worlds are implemented using the Oculus Rift. I specifically worked on creating a city world populated with buildings, functioning traffic lights, auto-spawned cars, and pedestrians. This project is intended to be used for a future study to observe the behavior of pedestrians when they cross the street. 

##### **Software Developer Intern - The Washington Post**
I worked on Post TV Android application, which plays short video clips summarizing the latest news. Using a wide variety of tools, all centering on Android Studio, I created features for the mobile app and also improved test coverage by writing unit tests. Interning at The Washington Post gave me exposure to the workings of a company that was evolving to embrace the changes in technology and incorporate it into its news products. Aside from working in the tech department, I was also able to see how other departments, such as social media and journalism, worked together. 

### Projects

##### **Personal Finance Portfolio**
This is an Android application that allows users to easily manage a financial portfolio using data that is pulled from Yahoo! Finance. Features include: seeing latest key metrics, looking up stocks, total value, various ratios, and ability to locate financial advisors nearby (using Yelp API). 

##### **SwiftHub**
Having been a big fan of Taylor Swift since I was eleven, I was inspired to make an Android application that kept me up-to-date with her social media activity during my busy school days.
